## [L-01] The error is not handled when LRT locker calls `PrelaunchPoints::claim()` and provides percentage more than 100

### Description
In this case when LRT locker calls `PrelaunchPoints::claim()` and provides a percentage amount more than 100% (i.e. 150%), because the percentage amount is not validated, as a result `userClaim` becomes larger than `userStake`, this will result in an arithematic underflow and this error is not handled.

Code

```solidity
@>  uint256 userClaim = userStake * _percentage / 100;
    _validateData(_token, userClaim, _exchange, _data);
@>    balances[msg.sender][_token] = userStake - userClaim;
```

### Impact
This will result in crashing the Dapp frontend and bad user experience.

### Recommended Mitigation
It should be validated that the percentage provided from the frontend is not more than 100%. The controls/validation should be implemented in the frontend and in smart contract as well.

## [L-02] The error is not handled when `PrelaunchPoints::convertAllETH` is called before `PrelaunchPoints::setLoopAddresses`

### Description
If the owner forgot to call `PrelaunchPoints::setLoopAddresses` or the owner may call this but due to some reason the call was not succeeded and now the owner tries to call `PrelaunchPoints::convertAllETH`. Then it will revert everytime with `EvmError: Revert` error. Because evertime `lpETH.deposit{value: totalBalance}(address(this))` will be executed and `deposit` function is called on `lpETH` without validating if the `lpETH` contract is actually set or not.

The error is not handled and any custom error is not thrown that actually shows the actual reason for this revert.

Code

```solidity
@> lpETH.deposit{value: totalBalance}(address(this))
```

### Impact
The actual reason for the revert is not shown that may frustrate the owner and also crash the Dapp frontend.

### Recommended Mitigation
To avoid any unexpected behaviour and vulnerability, before making any external call to a contract (that is supposed to be set manually before the call is made) setting must be validated first then external call should be given. This situation must also be handled using a custom error.

## [L-03 ] There is no dedicated functionality to withdraw `ethers` from `PrelanuchPoints` smart contract

### Description
The `PrelanuchPoints` smart contract is able to receive `ethers` at any point in time but there is no dedicated functionality to withdraw `ethers` that are sent directly/accidentally to `PrelanuchPoints` smart contract.

[Source](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-loop/blob/40167e469edde09969643b6808c57e25d1b9c203/src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L392C1-L392C34)

Code

```solidity
@>    receive() external payable {}
```

### Impact
Owner will not be able to withdraw/refund the directly received `ethers` to actual owners instead these will be used unfairly in the protocol as explained previously in `H-01`.

### Recommended Mitigation
There should be a dedicated `withdraw` function with `onlyAuthorized` modifier with restriction to be executed only after global conversion because all legit deposits and withdrawals will be completed by then.

## [C-01] Using `PrelaunchPoints::recoverERC20` function owner can withdraw any ERC20

### Description
If any ERC20 token is sent directly to `PrelaunchPoints` smart contract, owner can withdraw those tokens using `PrelaunchPoints::recoverERC20` function. Whereas those tokens are sent to `LoopFi protocol` not to the owner of the protocol. This is purely unfair and imposes a major centralization risk.

[Source](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-loop/blob/40167e469edde09969643b6808c57e25d1b9c203/src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L379C1-L386C6)

Code

```solidity
function recoverERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount) external onlyAuthorized {
    if (tokenAddress == address(lpETH) || isTokenAllowed[tokenAddress]) {
        revert NotValidToken();
    }
@>  IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(owner, tokenAmount);


    emit Recovered(tokenAddress, tokenAmount);
}
```

### Impact
This gives an unfair advantage to the owner. It will also affect the credibility of the `LoopFi protocol` hence affecting the market price of `lpETH` token.

### Recommended Mitigation
There should be proper mechanism in place to transfer these tokens to actual owners directly from the protocol. There should be no token transfers to `LoopFi` owner.
