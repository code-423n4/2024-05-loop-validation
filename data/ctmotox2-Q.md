**Discrepancy between README and PrelaunchPoints**

In the provided link of protocol readme, first line of the table of general questions we can see the ERC20 tokens used by protocol as below.

```ERC20 used by the protocol WETH, weETH, ezETH, rsETH, rswETH, uniETH, pufETH```

However in the PrelaunchPoints.sol contract, lpETH is also ERC20 and is used.
