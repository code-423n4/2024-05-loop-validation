1. Adding a return value to `_fillQuote()`
The `_fillQuote()` function makes a trade from a token to ETH:
```solidity
function _fillQuote(IERC20 _sellToken, uint256 _amount, bytes calldata _swapCallData) internal {
        // Track our balance of the buyToken to determine how much we've bought.
        uint256 boughtETHAmount = address(this).balance;

        require(_sellToken.approve(exchangeProxy, _amount));

        (bool success,) = payable(exchangeProxy).call{value: 0}(_swapCallData);
        if (!success) {
            revert SwapCallFailed();
        }

        // Use our current buyToken balance to determine how much we've bought.
        boughtETHAmount = address(this).balance - boughtETHAmount;
        emit SwappedTokens(address(_sellToken), _amount, boughtETHAmount);
    }
```
It caches the `address(this).balance` and then fetches it again after the swap. Return the final value of `boughtETHAmount` and use it in the `_claim()` function to properly compute the `claimedAmount` as the `claimedAmount` value in the `_claim()` function is subject to manipulations.

2. The emission of the `Claimed` event could be incorrect
Upon claiming using the `_claim()` function, there is the `Claimed` event emitted:
```solidity
function _claim(address _token, address _receiver, uint8 _percentage, Exchange _exchange, bytes calldata _data)
        internal
        returns (uint256 claimedAmount)
    {
        uint256 userStake = balances[msg.sender][_token];
        if (userStake == 0) {
            revert NothingToClaim();
        }
        if (_token == ETH) {
            claimedAmount = userStake.mulDiv(totalLpETH, totalSupply);
            balances[msg.sender][_token] = 0;
            lpETH.safeTransfer(_receiver, claimedAmount);
        } else {
            uint256 userClaim = userStake * _percentage / 100;
            _validateData(_token, userClaim, _exchange, _data);
            balances[msg.sender][_token] = userStake - userClaim;

            // At this point there should not be any ETH in the contract
            // Swap token to ETH
            _fillQuote(IERC20(_token), userClaim, _data);

            // Convert swapped ETH to lpETH (1 to 1 conversion)
            claimedAmount = address(this).balance;
            lpETH.deposit{value: claimedAmount}(_receiver);
        }
        emit Claimed(msg.sender, _token, claimedAmount);
    }
```
It uses the `claimedAmount` value which could be manipulated because in the `else` statement, we can see that it gets computed from the `address(this).balance` which could be manipulated by depositing just before the function call.

3. Incorrect comment in `_claim()`
This is a part of the `_claim()` function:
```solidity
else {
      uint256 userClaim = userStake * _percentage / 100;
      _validateData(_token, userClaim, _exchange, _data);
      balances[msg.sender][_token] = userStake - userClaim;

     // At this point there should not be any ETH in the contract
     // Swap token to ETH
     _fillQuote(IERC20(_token), userClaim, _data);

     // Convert swapped ETH to lpETH (1 to 1 conversion)
     claimedAmount = address(this).balance;
     lpETH.deposit{value: claimedAmount}(_receiver);
}
```
There is this comment there: `// At this point there should not be any ETH in the contract`. This is not true as Ether can be both deposited directly using the `receive()` function and also using selfdestruct.

4. Incorrect comment for the receive function
This is the receive function and the comment above it:
```solidity
/**
     * Enable receive ETH
     * @dev ETH sent to this contract directly will be locked forever.
     */
    receive() external payable {}
```
The comment is wrong as ETH will never be locked in the contract. If someone directly sends ETH to the contract before the conversion of ETH, it will be converted into the lpETH token. If it gets send after the conversion, it will be again swapped into lpETH upon the claim of any of the allowed tokens.
